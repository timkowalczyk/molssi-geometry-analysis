MolSSI Teach-the-Teacher Workshop: Geometry Analysis project
The focus of this repository is a python script for geometry analysis, molssi_geometry_analysis.py, which was developed as part of the first MolSSI teach-the-teacher workshop. Data used during the workshop is also included in this repository to keep it self-contained. The creation of this git repository on the command line was part of the workshop, including the push to this page on github.
